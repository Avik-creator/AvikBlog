        Well, well, well, look at Mr. No-Projects over here, the Picasso of
        procrastination and the master of the art of doing absolutely nothing!
        This guy has achieved the impressive feat of turning laziness into an
        art form. While the rest of us are out here building empires, he's the
        undisputed champion of the{" "}
        <b>"Let's see how long I can avoid starting a project"</b> game. Rumor
        has it, he once contemplated creating a project about not having any
        projects, but that would've been too meta for his non-existent
        portfolio. So, hats off to the project-less prodigy, the maestro of
        idleness!
